/**
 * This class represents the racetrack board.
 *
 * <p>The racetrack board consists of a rectangular grid of 'width' columns and 'height' rows.
 * The zero point of he grid is at the top left. The x-axis points to the right and the y-axis points downwards.</p>
 * <p>Positions on the track grid are specified using {@link PositionVector} objects. These are vectors containing an
 * x/y coordinate pair, pointing from the zero-point (top-left) to the addressed space in the grid.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each position in the grid represents a space which can hold an enum object of type {@link SpaceType}.<br>
 * Possible Space types are:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>WALL : road boundary or off track space</li>
 *  <li>TRACK: road or open track space</li>
 *  <li>FINISH_LEFT, FINISH_RIGHT, FINISH_UP, FINISH_DOWN :  finish line spaces which have to be crossed
 *      in the indicated direction to winn the race.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Beside the board the track contains the list of cars, with their current state (position, velocity, crashed,...)</p>
 *
 * <p>At initialization the track grid data is read from the given track file. The track data must be a
 * rectangular block of text. Empty lines at the start are ignored. Processing stops at the first empty line
 * following a non-empty line, or at the end of the file.</p>
 * <p>Characters in the line represent SpaceTypes. The mapping of the Characters is as follows:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>WALL : '#'</li>
 *   <li>TRACK: ' '</li>
 *   <li>FINISH_LEFT : '&lt;'</li>
 *   <li>FINISH_RIGHT: '&gt;'</li>
 *   <li>FINISH_UP   : '^;'</li>
 *   <li>FINISH_DOWN: 'v'</li>
 *   <li>Any other character indicates the starting position of a car.<br>
 *       The character acts as the id for the car and must be unique.<br>
 *       There are 1 to {@link TrackSpecification#MAX_CARS} allowed. </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All lines must have the same length, used to initialize the grid width).<br/>
 * Beginning empty lines are skipped. <br/>
 * The track ends with the first empty line or the file end.<br>
 * An {@link InvalidFileFormatException} is thrown, if
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the file contains no track lines (grid height is 0)</li>
 *   <li>not all track lines have the same length</li>
 *   <li>the file contains no cars</li>
 *   <li>the file contains more than {@link TrackSpecification#MAX_CARS} cars</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The Tracks {@link #toString()} method returns a String representing the current state of the race
 * (including car positions and status)</p>
